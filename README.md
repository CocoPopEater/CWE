A FabricMc mod intended to mimic some WorldEdit features using vanilla commands.

Primary use case is Minecraft Realms.

Usage on PaperMc/Spigot servers is likely to get you kicked for spam.

For PaperMc/Spigot servers there is no reason not to use the official WorldEdit mod/plugin as those will be more well written and optimized. Along with having many more features.
